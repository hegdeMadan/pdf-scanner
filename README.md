# uscanner
##  Setting up environment

1. Head over to React Native [official website](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to setup react-native environment
> We don't use Expo-cli so make sure you follow **React Native CLI Quickstart** guid.
2. Clone this project and [native_modules](https://github.com/hegdeMadan/native_modules) in the same folder.
3. Navigate to uscanner on your terminal (Command prompt in Windown) and run `yarn install`.
4. Now you're all set to run the application on your device.
